# Tidy-tree Layout

The **tidy-tree** layout arranges nodes in a hierarchical, tree-like structure. It is especially useful for diagrams where parent-child relationships are important, such as mindmaps.

## Features

- Organizes nodes in a tidy, non-overlapping tree
- Ideal for mindmaps and hierarchical data
- Automatically adjusts spacing for readability

## Example Usage

```
---
config:
  layout: tidy-tree
---
mindmap
root((mindmap is a long thing))
  A
  B
  C
  D
```

```
 ---
      config:
        layout: tidy-tree
      ---
      mindmap
      root((mindmap))
        Origins
          Long history
          ::icon(fa fa-book)

## Note

- Currently, tidy-tree is primarily supported for mindmap diagrams.
